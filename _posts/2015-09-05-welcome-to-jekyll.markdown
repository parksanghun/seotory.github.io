jekyll 문법 테스트용 페이지입니다.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:


{% highlight ruby linenos %}
def print_hi(name)
	puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
# prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight java linenos %}
public class Users implements Cloneable {
    private List userList;

    public Users() {
        userList = new ArrayList();
    }

    public Users(List list) {
        this.userList = list;
    }

    public void loadData () {
        userList.add("ssw");
        userList.add("bjh");
        userList.add("ysm");
        userList.add("hoj");
    }

    public List getUserList() {
        return userList;
    }

    @Override
    public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        List temp = new ArrayList();
        for (String s : this.getUserList()) {
            temp.add(s);
        }
        return new Users(temp);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is some text.[^1]. Other text.[^footnote].

[^1]: Some *crazy* footnote definition.

[^footnote]:

        as well as code blocks

    or, naturally, simple paragraphs.

[^other-note]:       no code block here (spaces are stripped away)
